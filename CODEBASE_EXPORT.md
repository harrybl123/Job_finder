# Career Navigator - Complete Codebase Export

**Generated:** 2025-11-24  
**Purpose:** LLM analysis and debugging

This file contains the complete source code of the Career Navigator application.

## Current Issues Being Debugged
1. **Empty Galaxy**: Users see only stars, no career nodes visible despite nodes being generated
2. **Visibility System**: `visibleNodeIds` state management may have timing issues

## Project Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components (CareerGalaxy, ChatInterface, etc.)
- `src/data/` - Static data (career galaxy nodes, constellations)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions (layout generation, etc.)
- `src/services/` - External service integrations
- `prisma/` - Database schema and config
